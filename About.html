    <h4>I also enjoy playing and practicing my skills and techniques on my viola.</h4>
    <p class = "About-p">I never had the opprotunity playing the viola when I was growing up (it is an expensive hoby!). When I first
        played it in highschool I have never been more determined and excited to learn it as soon as possible and get 
        even better at playing it. It is such a relaxing (and sometimes annoying) pass time. I hope to further my skills
        and have enough confidence to play for others and to play in a orchestra!

    <h4>I am also a big foodie!</h4>
    <p class = "About-p" id="Last-About-p">I enjoy trying new kinds of food and also learning how to make the foods that I like. From what I expereinced,
        food carries a lot of history and meaning into them. Its fun leanring about a dishes origin and/or the cultural
        significance of the dish.
