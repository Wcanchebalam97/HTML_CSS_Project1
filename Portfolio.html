<h3>Adidas Mock Homepage</h3>

<p class = "Port-p">I was learning about webpage development and wanted to create a scenario of building one for
     a big company. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS through this project.

<h3>Rios on Fire (Version 1)</h3>

<p class = "Port-p">A friend was talking about wanting to open an online store and see what it would look like.
     I wanted to find different ways to apply what I am learning and offered to make a version 1 of his vision. 
     I also learned that we should also make his site mobile friendly and try to accommodate that as well.
